This is just a test setup for me to learn the ins and out of Git.

It seems the best way to work with Git so far is to:

1. Edit my files
2. Open git-bash
3. Do a git commit -am 'Message head' -m 'Message body
    (This will give the standard git commit format)
    (Also git commit -am $'Head\n\nBody' also seems to work)
    (Additionally I can use "git add ." then git commit)
4. Next if I want to update the git-hub, I need to do a
    git push

(I can do a git status to see the list of changes. The git-gui is also
    good for showing and browsing the changes and staging them.)

Next, I'll need to learn how to update my workflow to include a development
branch. (dev)

Since I'm planning on using my PC and my Laptop, I'll have to learn a good way
of updating the server to move the files back and forth.

Need to try learning how to merge changes from the dev into the production
branch

Also, need to learn how to use the tag command to make "Revisions" of the code
in the production branch.

Once I get a handle on these basics I can start trying to use git-hub
to serve my Python script samples for Idle-Logic.com.
